# Actorbase-Driver

Actorbase is essentially an actor system built upon a server component that exposes some API forming a REST- ful web service. To facilitate the use from inside a Scala source, a driver has been developed in order to allow the usage of all features that Actorbase provides.

The driver is the best way to interact with Actorbase for developers.

It returns navigable collections in which is possible to make operations that will have instantly effect on the server.
